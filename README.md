# Waste-Audit-Game
//A short game to introduce players to waste audits

/*
3D Game showing how a waste audit actually works?
- Have different environments to highlight different hazards

- Maybe a satellite, over Earth
  - Zoom in over Earth, NZ, Auckland, UoA
  - Show the pollution and landfills
 - Maybe have the player move a landfill vehicle around sorting out the trash?
  - Or not, since having a landfill compaction vehicle would not allow for finer sorting
  - Maybe set it up like a waste audit?
   - Have the scene start out at aa landfill, then take the approximate amount of trash needed for a waste audit (i.e. 8 trash bags?) and have them see the comparative difference
   - Then move onto another scene where the game actually starts
    - In this scene, there would be a flatsheet, where the trash bags are located
    - Recycle bins
    - Protective Gear
     - Choose what gear to put on (Maybe at the start?)
     - Include some relevant and some not so relevant equipment
      - If the user chooses all equipment that is necessary, there will be no added risks (i.e. risk of cuts, poisoning, burns etc. that may arise from choosing the wrong equipment)
    - Weighing scale
 - Use statistics from Auckland University
  - 2006: 36% of recyclables sent to the landfill - down to 12% in 2015
   - Increase in relative portion of the food waste though
  - 
 
Environments:
- Player would be told the environment at the start, so they can decide what gear to wear etc.
- Where are we doing the audit? (different hazards to look out for in different environments)
 - Carpark
 - Park
 - Centre
 - etc.
- Allow for customisation of the environment as well as providing some default settings

Hazards:
- Hazards may include chemicals/ dangerous trash
- Glass (Broken)
- Chemical waste

Hazard Management:
- WHen encountering hazards, adopt the proper method to deal with it

 Gameplay:
- Arrows as controls/ WASD?
- Space to pick up and drop off trash?
- Shift to start running (-5 if it is used - NEVER run at a waste audit)

Points System:
- For each right sort, +1
- For each wrong sort, -1
- Correct gear selection, +5
- Incorrect gear selection, +0 (with additional risk of injuries, poisoning etc.)
- Have the player go through the procedure (of the waste audit) themselves
 - Correct procedure all the way: +10
 - Incorrect procedure: +0
 - Procedure:
  - Select gear
  - Rip open the trash bags and pick out the items that spill out
   - Do NOT reach into the bag (-1 for each time you reach into the bag)
  - After sorting the trash, weigh each component and note the weights down

Order:
- Home page
- Select the environment
- Select gear
- Start audit
- Weigh the boxes
- Take the weights down
- End audit
